# THIS SOFTWARE IS NAMED AS 'ENIGMA'
# INTRODUCTION :
# NOWADAYS BEING A PROGRAMMER THE MAJOR ISSUE IS OF CONNECTING SEVERAL SEGMENTS OF A PROGRAM AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS TOGETHER
# OR OF TRANSFERRING LARGE CHUNKS OF PROGRAM FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER ON OUR SYSTEMS.WHEN WE CREATE A PROGRAM MOST OF THE TIME
# WE IMPORT SEVERAL PROGRAMS AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN OUR COMPUTER INTO OUR SOURCE FILE AND THUS INCREASING THE PROCESSING TIME
# THUS INTRODUCING ENIGMA WHICH CAN HELP IN TRANSFERRING LARGE DATA FROM ONE FILE INTO ANOTHER IN A FLUENT AND USER FRIENDLY MANNER
# NOW THE USER DOESNT NEED TO COPY PASTE OR IMPORT PROGRAM FROM DIFFERENT LOCATIONS INTO THE SOURCE FILE WITH THE HELP OF ENIGMA 
# THE USER CAN EASILY HANDLE LARGE PROGRAM FILES WITHOUT EVEN OPENING THEM.IF THE USER WANTS TO ADD DATA FROM ONE LARGE FILE INTO
# ANOTHER LARGE FILE THEN WITHOUT OPENING ANY OF THEM AND WASTING TIME IN WAITING FOR THE FILES TO OPEN THE USER CAN DIRECTLY
# ACCESS THERE DATA AND CAN EXPORT THE DATA INTO A NEW FILE,ADD THAT DATA INTO ANOTHER FILE(EG.SOURCE FILE) AND CAN DELETE DATA
# FROM THE FILE WHERE THE DATA HAS BEEN ADDED OR EXPORTED PREVIOUSLY USING ENIGMA .

# ADDING DATA OF ONE FILE INTO ANOTHER FILE :
# THINK OF A CONDITION WHEN WE ARE MAKING A SOFTWARE AND WE HAVE A GIGANTIC PROGRAM WHICH ACTS AS A FUNCTION OF OUR SOFTWARE
# BUT IS TOO BIG AND AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND IS INCREASING OUR SOFTWARES PROCESSING TIME ,NOW USER CAN EITHER ADD THE FUNCTIONS
# PROGRAMMING INTO THE SOURCE FILE BUT OPENING THOSE GIGANTIC PROGRAMS CAN TAKE A LOT OF TIME ON AN AVERAGE COMPUTER THUS WITH 
# ENIGMA THE USER CAN EASILY TRANSFER THE GIGANTIC PROGRAM OF FUNCTION INTO THE SOURCE FILE IN 1/10TH TIME TAKEN BY COPY
# AND PASTING THE PROGRAMMING . ENIGMA ALLOWS USER TO OPERATE WITHIN FILES AT SIMMILAR LOCATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERENT LOCATIONS


# EXPORTING DATA INTO A NEW FILE :
# THIS METHOD IS ALSO USEFUL FOR PROGRAMMER BECAUSE IF A PROGRAMMER IS TRYING TO CREATE A SOURCE FILE BY COMPILING SEVERAL SEGMENTS
# THE EXPORT METHOD IS A GOOD FUNCTION FOR TRANSFERRING LARGE FILES FROM COMPUTER INTO AN EXTERNAL DRIVE OR INTO ANOTHER FOLDER
# THE EXPORT METHOD IS ALSO USEFUL AS IT CAN BE USED TO CREATE MULTIPLECOPIES OF A PROGRAM FILE 

# REMOVING DATA FROM A FILE :
# ENIGMA HAS THE FULL CAPABILITY TO REMOVE DATA FROM A FILE WHERE DATA HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN ADDED OR EXPORTED USING ENIGMA
# WHEN WE HAVE TO REMOVE SOME DATA FROM A LARGE PROGRAMMING FILE ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS FINDING THAT PARTICULAR PHASE WITH
# THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAMMING LINE'S WHICH WE WANT TO REMOVE THUS WITH ENIGMA AFTER EVERY TRANSFER THE TRANSFERRED DATA'S SECOND
# COPY IS STORED AND IS GIVEN A NUMBER WHICH IS IN SEQUENCE TO TRANSACTION LIKE THE DATA TRANSFERRED IN 3RD TRANSACTION WILL BE STORED
# IN FILE '3.TXT'.
# USING ENIGMA WITHOUT OPENING THE LARGE FILES WE CAN EASILY DELETE DATA FROM THE FILE AND THUS ELIMINATING THE TIME WASTED IN 
# OPENING THE FILE
